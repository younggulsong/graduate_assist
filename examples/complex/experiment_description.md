Objective: Assess how field treatments (control, NPK, organic, drought, lime) influence soil chemistry, moisture, microbial activity, and crop yield across multiple sites and plots over a growing season.
Hypothesis: NPK and organic treatments will increase nitrogen/phosphorus/potassium levels and yield relative to control, while drought reduces moisture and yield; lime will raise soil pH.
Independent Variables: treatment, site, plot_id, collection_date, is_irrigated
Dependent Variables: yield_g, microbial_index, nitrogen_mgkg, phosphorus_mgkg, potassium_mgkg, moisture_pct, ph
Controls: shared sampling protocol, standardized measurement instruments, consistent plot sizes within each site
Constraints: field conditions vary by weather; sampling dates span one year; sensor_status and qc_status flag data quality limitations

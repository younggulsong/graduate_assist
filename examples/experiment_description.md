Objective: Evaluate whether a nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium (NPK) fertilizer blend increases early plant height relative to an unfertilized control.
Hypothesis: Plants receiving NPK fertilizer will exhibit higher mean growth after 21 days than control plants.
Independent Variables: treatment group (control vs NPK)
Dependent Variables: growth_cm
Controls: identical soil substrate, watering schedule, light exposure, seed batch
Constraints: greenhouse temperature held at 22-24C; measurement at day 21 only
